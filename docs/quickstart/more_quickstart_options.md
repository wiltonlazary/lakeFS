# More Quickstart Options

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** The quickstart section is for learning purposes. The installations below will not persist your data.
Instead, it will spin-up a database in a docker container, which will be discarded later.

For a production suitable deployment, see [Deploy](../deploy/prerequisites.md).
{% endhint %}

## Docker on Windows

To run a local lakeFS instance using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/):

1. Ensure you have Docker installed on your computer, and that compose version is 1.25.04 or higher. For more information, please see this [issue](https://github.com/treeverse/lakeFS/issues/894).

1. Run the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   Invoke-WebRequest https://compose.lakefs.io | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Content | docker-compose -f - up
   ```

1. Check your installation by opening [http://127.0.0.1:8000/setup](http://127.0.0.1:8000/setup) in your web browser.


## On Kubernetes with Helm

You can install lakeFS on a Kubernetes cluster with the following commands:

```bash
# Add the lakeFS Helm repository
helm repo add lakefs https://charts.lakefs.io
# Deploy lakeFS with helm release "my-lakefs"
helm install my-lakefs lakefs/lakefs
```

## Using the Binary 

Alternatively, you may opt to run the lakefs binary directly on your computer.

1. Download the lakeFS binary for your operating system:

   [Download lakefs](../index.md#downloads)

1. Install and configure [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

1. Create a configuration file:

   ```yaml
   ---
   database:
     connection_string: "postgres://localhost:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable"
    
   blockstore: 
     type: "local"
     local:
       path: "~/lakefs_data"
    
   auth:
     encrypt:
       secret_key: "a random string that should be kept secret"
   gateways:
     s3:
       domain_name: s3.local.lakefs.io:8000
   ```

1. Create a local directory to store objects:

   ```bash
   mkdir ~/lakefs_data
   ```

1. Run the server:

   ```bash
   ./lakefs --config /path/to/config.yaml run
   ```
